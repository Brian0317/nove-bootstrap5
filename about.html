						Brian established himself as a tenacious leader with a keen eye on improving efficiency by working his way through every facet of the industry. In the body shop, he learned all aspects of operations and within wholesale distribution, he managed sales, marketing, operations, website and software design. Brian’s breadth of experience allowed him to do what he does best, make things better. He never took “no” for an answer and was committed to finding a solution for the industry. His vision for MidwayPlus was to develop a technology for aftermarket brands to have more business choices, build better relationships, and showcase their products in an easier and more efficient way.
						Lounsberry is a member of Performance Racing Industry (PRI) and Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA), where he also served on the board of directors.
